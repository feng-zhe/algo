# Complexity
- Dijkstra: with priority queue O(|E| + |V|log(|V|); without O(|V|^2)
-	A*: 	

# Tips
-	When get stucked
    - Try Greedy and DP.
    - Try an easier version of the problem. e.g. Two dimensions to one dimension(No.296).
-	Union-find to solve disjointed set problem; While DFS + coloring to solve exclusive grouping problem(No. 886).
